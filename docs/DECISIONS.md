# Decisions and deviations

Dated list of decisions and deviations from `HANDOFF.md` (OP5, OP7).

## 2026-10-05 (M0)

### Scaffold generated Jest-style names and extra tooling
- **Spec said:** unit tests are `*.test.ts` next to source; API e2e tests are `apps/api/test/*.e2e.test.ts`; Biome is the only lint/format tool.
- **Did:** the NestJS 12 scaffold uses `*.spec.ts` / `*.e2e-spec.ts`, oxlint and prettier. Changed both Vitest configs to the spec's file patterns and removed oxlint, oxlint-tsgolint and prettier.
- **Why:** spec naming and "delete any ESLint, Prettier or oxlint config" are binding; the scaffold's build and Vitest setup was otherwise kept.

### TypeScript versions differ per workspace
- **Spec said:** TypeScript, latest stable.
- **Did:** `packages/core` and `packages/cli` use `^7.0.2` (latest). `apps/api` keeps the NestJS scaffold's `^6` and `apps/web` keeps create-next-app's `^5`.
- **Why:** the two scaffolds pin a version their tooling is tested with (decorator metadata in the API, Next's type plugin). Revisit when upgrading. Vitest is `^5` everywhere (the API was bumped from the scaffold's `^4`).

### Removed `nest deploy` script and `@nestjs/mau`
- **Did:** deleted the scaffold's `deploy` script and the `@nestjs/mau` dev dependency.
- **Why:** deploying is out of scope (OP6) and cloud commands are forbidden (OP8).

### `apps/api/tsconfig.build.json` excludes `*.test.ts`
- **Did:** changed the scaffold's `**/*spec.ts` exclude to `**/*.test.ts`.
- **Why:** unit tests use the `.test.ts` suffix, so `nest build` must not compile them into `dist`.

### `apps/web` target is ES2023
- **Did:** replaced create-next-app's `ES2017` target with `ES2023` (the base config's value).
- **Why:** spec requires the base target everywhere.

### `@playwright/test` installed at the repo root in M0
- **Spec said:** one Playwright smoke test arrives in M7.
- **Did:** added `@playwright/test` as a root dev dependency now. The CI `e2e` job runs `pnpm exec playwright install`, which fails if no workspace package provides the binary.
- **Why:** M0 requires a CI workflow that can run; Playwright is named in the spec's Toolchain table (OP7).

### CI action versions
- **Did:** `actions/checkout@v7`, `actions/setup-node@v7`, `pnpm/action-setup@v6`, the latest majors on 2026-10-06 (checked with `git ls-remote --tags`).

### Web `typecheck` runs `next typegen` first
- **Did:** `apps/web` script is `next typegen && tsc --noEmit`.
- **Why:** `LayoutProps` comes from generated `.next/types`, which is git-ignored, so a fresh clone fails `tsc` otherwise.

### `zod` added to `apps/api` and `apps/web`
- **Spec said (OP7):** web runtime dependencies are Next.js, React, Tailwind; `zod` is listed for core only.
- **Did:** added `zod` to `apps/api` (for `src/config.ts`) and `apps/web` (for `src/env.ts`).
- **Why:** the spec requires `apps/web/src/env.ts` to be the only place reading `process.env`, and Zod is the spec's validation tool.

### create-next-app extras removed
- **Did:** removed the generated `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, nested lockfile/workspace file, sample SVGs and the dark-mode CSS. Moved its `allowBuilds` (sharp, unrs-resolver set to false) into the root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- **Why:** repo has one lockfile and one `CLAUDE.md`; light theme only.

### No commits by the assistant
- **Spec said (OP3, Git):** commit at the end of each milestone.
- **Did:** the repo owner asked to stage, commit and push personally, so the assistant stops before the commit and lists the changed files.
- **Why:** explicit user instruction. The reviewer reviews the working tree instead of `git diff <start-ref>`.
